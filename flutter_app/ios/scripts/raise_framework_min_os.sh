# Raises MinimumOSVersion on everything embedded in the app bundle, as a build
# phase, so the archive is correct when it is produced rather than corrected
# afterwards.
#
# Validation 90068 rejects an upload whose embedded binaries declare a
# MinimumOSVersion below Apple's floor, and two sources here sit below it no
# matter what IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET says:
#
#   - The Flutter engine ships Flutter.framework and App.framework at its own
#     floor (13.0 as of Flutter 3.44). Setting MinimumOSVersion in
#     ios/Flutter/AppFrameworkInfo.plist does not help: the tool rewrites that
#     plist during the build.
#   - YmirCore.framework is built by native/ymir_core/ios/build-ios-macos.sh
#     against whatever floor that build used, which is not necessarily the
#     Runner's.
#
# Both bare dylibs and .framework bundles are patched. The core is dlopen'd by
# absolute path out of Frameworks/ rather than linked, so nothing else in the
# build has a reason to touch it.
#
# Both places the version is recorded have to agree -- the Info.plist key and
# the Mach-O LC_BUILD_VERSION load command -- because Apple reads the load
# command, not just the plist.
#
# Runs as the last phase of the Runner target: after "Thin Binary"
# (embed_and_thin), "[CP] Embed Pods Frameworks" and the Embed Frameworks phase
# that copies the cores have all put everything in place. Editing a binary
# invalidates its signature, so each one is re-signed here with
# EXPANDED_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY, the identity Xcode resolved for this build --
# which is what makes this work under Xcode Cloud's managed signing, where no
# identity can be named ahead of time. Xcode signs the outer .app after all
# build phases, so the app's own signature is unaffected.
