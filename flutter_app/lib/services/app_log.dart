// app_log.dart — A log the user can actually send me.
//
// Mirrors ViceMultiplatform's AppLog. Records Dart-side events to
// memory + a file under the app's per-platform data dir.
//
// The log file lives at [YmirCorePaths.appLogPath] -- the same
// platform-agnostic data dir the NVRAM + SMPC state + session
// snapshot files live in. The user grabs it via the in-app Logs
// screen (which renders the in-memory tail + reads the file back),
// which is the access path that works identically on Android, iOS,
// and Linux. The previous incarnation wrote to the Android external
// files dir so the file showed up in the Files app, which was the
// right thing for Android but iOS-specific support (UIFileSharingEnabled
// + LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace) made the iOS twin awkward,
// and Linux has no equivalent.
