# --- Fixtures ---------------------------------------------------------------
# The BIOS is Sega copyright and is never bundled, so the screenshots that show
# a booted machine need it staged into the app's container at run time.
#
# It has to be staged by a SEPARATE PROCESS, running alongside the test, and
# that is not a style choice. `flutter drive` installs the app, and an install
# hands it a brand new data container -- so anything staged beforehand is gone,
# and the container's name is not known until it exists. Doing it from the
# driver does not work either: the driver receives its callbacks only after the
# test method has finished, so a seed triggered that way lands after every
# screenshot has already been taken.
#
# So: poll for the container, and copy the moment it appears. The test waits
# for the files rather than assuming them.
#
# Note it is the CONTENTS of SHOT_SEED that land in Documents -- point it at
# the folder CONTAINING Retro-Saturn/, not at Retro-Saturn/ itself.
